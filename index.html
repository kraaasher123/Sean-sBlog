    <h2>The Actual Blog Post</h2>
    <p>The Topic for the Blog Post will be about "Speedcubing".</p>

    <p>
    First of all, What is Speedcubing? Speedcubing is a sport in which you have to solve a Rubik's Cube as fast as you can.
    So it's kind of like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun">speedrunning</a> but with Rubik's Cubes.
    </p>
    <p>You might be wondering, "There should be a world record right?".</p>
    <p>Yes! There definitely is! The World Record in solving the Rubik's Cube (as of now) is 3.47 seconds, set by Chinese Speedcuber Yu Sheng Du</p>

    <p>Where are the past world record times stored? They are stored in the World Cube Association.</p>
    <p>What is the World Cube Association? The World Cube Association governs competitions for mechanical puzzles that are operated by twisting groups of pieces, commonly known as 'twisty puzzles'.</p>

    <p>So, How do you learn to speedcube? First of all, you have to learn a method to solve it.
        the most popular method for beginners is called the "Layer by Layer" method.
    </p>
    <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Rubik%27s_Cube_layer_by_layer_solution_overview.jpg/400px-Rubik%27s_Cube_layer_by_layer_solution_overview.jpg">
    <p>But, Layer by Layer is slow, that is why there are methods invented specifically for speedcubing.</p>
    <p>The first and probably the most popular method is CFOP. CFOP stands for Cross, F2L (First Two Layers), OLL (Orient Last Layer), and PLL (Permute Last Layer)</p>
    <img src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MS5jByTX_pk/maxresdefault.jpg" width = 80% height = 80%>
    <p>The second method is called the Roux Method. It is a method in which you have to start by building the First Block, Second Block, CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer), and finally the LSE (Last Six Edges)</p>

    <p>The third method is called ZZ short for Zbigniew Zbrowoski (the inventor of the method). This is one of the more hard-to-understand methods, ZBLL (Zbrowoski Last Layer) consists of a whopping 493 <a href = "https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/algorithm/">Algorithms</a>! That's alot!</p>
    <img src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iNSUBnWaRxo/maxresdefault.jpg" width = 80% height = 80%>
    <p>There are so many methods in speedcubing that I could cover but I should mention these methods, Old Pochmann, CFCE, and Edges First</p>
    <h3>Tips and Advice when starting out on Speedcubing</h3>
    
        
        <p>1. Get a Speedcube, you should <span>not</span> use the regular Rubik's Cubes since they are slower and not optimized for speedcubing.
        I would recommend getting the "RS3M 2021 Maglev", the "Qiyi Mofangge ThunderClap V3M", or the "Meilong 3M"</p>
        <img src = "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0646/0891/products/Yulong3x3SL_7b551868-8acd-4d34-acb2-4869b6488575_1024x.jpg?v=1621491325" width = 60% height = 60%>

        
        <p>2. Well obviously, you have to learn a method. I would recommend either CFOP or ROUX</p>

        <p>3. Practice makes perfect, it's really important for your speedcubing journey</p>

        <p>4. Watch youtube tutorials, that's how I learned to speedcube</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Ron6MN45LY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>5. My final tip, is to enjoy cubing. You can never get good at something you don't enjoy</p>
        <img src = "https://img.redbull.com/images/c_limit,w_1500,h_1000,f_auto,q_auto/redbullcom/2019/11/14/ccc5b9cc-8c43-47e1-b9fa-a54c5dc60d06/feliks-zemdegs-rubiks-cube-2018" width = 80% height = 80%>
        <p>Well, that's all my tips. I should mention these youtube channels that could help you on your speedcubing journey</p>
        
        <ul class = "channels">

        </ul>
        <p>So, Why start Speedcubing? Well, speedcubing is really fun and addictive, you can never let go of the cube. Another reason is bragging rights.
            Really, the only reason I started speedcubing was because I wanted to flex my fast times. It can also help with your fine motor skills by using your fingers.
            There's a whole documentary on speedcubing really recommend checking it out.

        <p>I think this is pretty much it for this blog post, pretty fun to make. Oh and if you happen to start cubing then I only have two words for you:</p>
